# Amazon&#39;s PHP SDK in a Kohana module

This will enable you to use Amazon's PHP SDK library inside the Kohana framework.

## Quick Start

* Copy the config file 'aws.php' into your application's config folder and replace the information with your own.
	* This is what is used inside the CFCredentials class (inside the config.inc.php file in Amazon's PHP SDK)
* Then just start using the classes as found in Amazon's [documentation](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSDKforPHP/latest/)
